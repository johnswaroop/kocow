# Booking Interface Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the booking interface of Kohinoor Spaces coworking application. The focus is on creating a functional and visually appealing booking experience that aligns with the glassmorphism design language used throughout the application.

## Data Structure

### Spaces Collection

```
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  description: String,
  capacity: Number,
  hourlyRate: Number,
  amenities: Array,
  images: Array,
  category: String
}
```

### Bookings Collection

```
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId (ref: Users),
  spaceId: ObjectId (ref: Spaces),
  date: Date,
  startTime: String,
  endTime: String,
  duration: Number,
  status: String (confirmed, cancelled, completed),
  totalAmount: Number,
  termsAccepted: Boolean,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

## API Endpoints

- `/api/spaces` - GET (list spaces), GET/:id (space details)
- `/api/bookings` - POST (create booking), GET (user's bookings)

## UI Components

### Space Browsing

- Grid/list view of available spaces
- Space cards with:
  - Featured image
  - Space name and short description
  - Amenities icons
  - Capacity indicator
  - Hourly rate
  - "Book Now" button
- Detail view when clicking on a space with:
  - Image gallery
  - Complete description
  - Full amenities list
  - Capacity details
  - Pricing information
  - Booking button
- Basic filtering by amenity type or space category

### Calendar & Time Selection

- Monthly calendar view for date selection
- Simple time slot picker with fixed 1-hour increments
- Duration selector (1hr, 2hrs, half-day, full-day options)
- Static pricing display based on selection

### Terms & Conditions

- Dedicated step with scrollable container for full legal terms
- Glass-style container with proper contrast for readability
- Checkbox requiring explicit acceptance to proceed
- "I have read and agree to the terms and conditions" confirmation
- Option to download/save terms as PDF

### Booking Process

- Multi-step form:
  1. Space selection
  2. Date/time selection
  3. Terms & conditions review and acceptance
  4. Review & confirm
- Progress indicator showing current step

- Confirmation page with booking details

## Functionality

- Price calculation based on duration
- Form validation for required fields
- Terms agreement validation (must scroll through terms)
- Basic booking creation and storage
- Booking confirmation display
- Option to view booking in user profile

## User Experience Considerations

- Maintain glassmorphism design pattern across all components
- Smooth transitions between booking steps
- Mobile-responsive design for all booking components
- Helpful tooltips for complex options
- Clear highlighting of important terms and conditions sections
- Loading states for form submissions
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## Implementation Approach

1. Build static UI components first
2. Implement Space model and API endpoints with static data
3. Create browsing interface with space cards and detail views
4. Implement basic calendar and time selection components
5. Build terms and conditions component with scroll tracking
6. Create booking summary and confirmation screens
7. Connect components to save bookings to the database

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Real-time availability checking
- Capacity management (prevent overbooking)
- "Hold" temporary booking during checkout flow
- Advanced filtering and search
- Favorite/save spaces feature
- Recurring booking options
